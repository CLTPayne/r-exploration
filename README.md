# Data Science / R exploration

### Set up
You'll need to install a few things.  We can do that together or you can do it in advance.  Up to you.
1. RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
2. R (get version 3.3.3 rather than the latest one) https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
3. Then you'll need to install a package called 'tidyverse', in an r console. In your R Studio terminal, do r to open a new R session then `install.packages('tidyverse')`

### Execution in R Studio
- run the file as a whole (rather than line by line) cmd + shift + return
- run a line in the file, place the cursor in the line and cmd + return

### Further exploration
- Package for R called Shiny from rstudio - enables you to build web apps to visualise and play with data
- Can deploy to shinyapps and get free hosting
